                <h3>How do I unsubscribe?</h3>

                <p>To unsubscribe from email notifications, click the cleverly named
                    'unsubscribe' link that appears at the bottom of each message.</p>

                <p>To unsubscribe from text/sms notifications, <a href="/unsubscribe-sms.html">use this form</a>.</p>


                <h3>How do I change my address?</h3>

                <p>Just unsubscribe (see above), then re-subscribe with your new address.</p>


                <h3>Why aren't I getting notifications?</h3>

                <p>Likely one of several reasons: maybe you didn't click the 'verify' link in the
                    email/message that was sent after you registered, or maybe the messages
                    are finding their way to your spam folder, or maybe no incidents have been reported
                    within a 0.25 mile radius of the address you registered.</p>


                <h3>What do these codes mean and why are they so vague?</h3>

                <p>Your guess is as good as mine. I'm passing along all the <a href="http://www.slmpd.org/cfs.shtml">data that the SLMPD makes available</a>.</p>


                <h3>Can I get more information about an incident?</h3>

                <p>Your best bet for additional detail would be perusing the
                    <a href="http://www.slmpd.org/Crimereports.shtml">monthly crime reports</a> posted by the SLMPD.</p>


                <h3>Why are these notifications dated an hour ago?</h3>

                <p>In 2017, the SLPPD started delaying the call data by about 45 minutes.</p>
                <!--
                <p>This started when the clocks adjusted for Daylight Savings last spring.
                    My theory is that the incidents are still being posted by the SLMPD
                    immediately, but the times are off by an hour because their
                    system isn't accounting for DST. </p>
                -->


                <h3>Who runs this thing?</h3>

                <p>This is a free service built and managed by a Saint Louis resident during the summer of 2016. See this 
                    <a href="https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/new-st-louis-site-gives-real-time-alerts-on-nearby-crime-3087056">write-up in the RFT</a>.</p>

                <h3>How many people are using this?</h3>

                <p>Roughly 10,000 city residents are actively subscribed
                    and receiving notifications. SLMPD posts roughly 20,000 incidents each month.</p>


                <h3>Are there future plans to upgrade or expand?</h3>

                <p>Maybe, but most depend on some level of cooperation from the SLMPD. If you
                    know someone there, please put them in touch with me :)</p>
